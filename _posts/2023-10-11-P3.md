# Funcionamiento

For this practice we are going to use the Virtual Force Field (VFF), a navigation algorithm for local navigation that consists of:
-Each object in the environment generates a repulsive force towards the robot.
-Destiny generates an attractive force in the robot.

This makes it possible for the robot to go towards the target, distancing itself of the obstacles, so that their address is the vector sum of all the forces.

As we always do, we need to begin somewhere. In this case, we start trying to move forward towards the first target.
But as you can see in the gif below, we are not getting the correct values for the obstacles vector so we crash with the right wall and go out of the map.
