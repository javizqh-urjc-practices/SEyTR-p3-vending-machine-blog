title: Practica 3 - Obstacle Avoidance
---

**Disclaimer**: All this test was run using a 13th Gen Intel® Core™ i9-13900HX × 32, so the results may vary depending on the build of your system.
So if it crashes it may be due to the lack of power. Videos demostrating the work of the code will only be shown at the end because of the size limit of Github.

# Trying to move forward

For this practice we are going to use the Virtual Force Field (VFF), a navigation algorithm for local navigation that consists of:
-Each object in the environment generates a repulsive force towards the robot.
-Destiny generates an attractive force in the robot.

This makes it possible for the robot to go towards the target, distancing itself of the obstacles, so that their address is the vector sum of all the forces.

As we always do, we need to begin somewhere. In this case, we start trying to move forward towards the first target.
But as you can see in the gif below, we are not getting the correct values for the obstacles vector so we crash with the right wall and go out of the map.

        if dist > 10:
            dist = 10
        angle = math.radians(i-90) # because the front of the robot is -90 degrees
        laser += [(dist, angle)]

    objects = 0
    for i in parse_laser_data(HAL.getLaserData()):

    obsForce[1] = obsForce[1] / 180
    avgForce= [4.0, 0.0]
    avgForce[1] = carForce[1] + obsForce[1]
    print(obsForce[1])

    HAL.setV(avgForce[0])
    HAL.setW(avgForce[1])
```

# Going forward

We have managed to calculate correctly the obstacle vector using:
```python
def set_repulsion():
  laser = []
  for i in parse_laser_data(HAL.getLaserData()):
      x = i[0] * math.cos(i[1]) * 1 
      y = i[0] * math.sin(i[1]) * 1
      laser += [(x,y)]
      
  mean = np.mean(laser, axis = 0)
  return mean
```
But as we passed the first obstacle the car tries to avoid the second obstacle and crashes. This is due to the low distance needed to check that the target is reached, so for example to solve this issue we can change the 1 meter to 2.

# Closer to the end

Now we have solved the problem with the target but we have found a new one. Now the car crashes when another one is in front of it and it is exactly symmetrical with our car.

This problem is much harder to solve than the other one because this one is a problem that is caused by the VFF algorithm, so we need and exotic aproach to solve it.

# Lap completed and finished without crashing

Now the problem is solved, but as we can see in the video there are some problems that need to be adressed:

<video src="../images/p3final.mp4" controls title="Avoid obstacle demonstration"></video>

- When the target changes we can see some oscillations, that make the car move erratically.
- When we find a car in front of our car, as we don't have a 360 lidar, and as the first and the fourth car are symmetrical we cannot detect the object using VFF, so we used the deviation method. But this method has its own downsides, the biggest one being that as we modify the angular speed by a constant value if the value given is too big we can crash into a wall easily. Also another downside is the oscillations it creates when abruptly changing the deviation value, so this is why we add the counter to decrease it little by little.
- The lack of speed is also a huge downside but increasing causes the oscillations crated previously to be greater and crash the car
